# Optimized Power Scheme

A script that creates an additional optimized Windows power scheme named "**Optimized**" design tailored for maximum performance when using AC power and maximum energy savings when using DC.

There is a huge increase in frame stability in games, giving preference to productive cores, as well as a reduction in stuttering in games that use Easy Anti-Cheat to constantly scan device ports.

## Usage

Run the **Optimize Power Scheme.cmd** file.
