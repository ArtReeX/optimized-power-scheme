# Optimized Power Scheme

A script that creates an additional optimized Windows power scheme named "**Optimized**" design tailored for maximum performance when using AC power and maximum energy savings when using DC. There has been a huge increase in frame stability in games, as well as a reduction in stuttering in games using Easy Anti-Cheat that constantly scans device ports.

## Usage
