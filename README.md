# Optimized Power Scheme for Windows OS

A script that creates an additional optimized Windows power scheme named "**Optimized**" with more than 500 hidden parameters have been changed design tailored for maximum performance when using AC power and maximum energy savings when using DC.

The system affects only the power scheme and nothing else. Administrator rights are not required to run. The contents of the file are open source so that you make sure the transparency of the changes made.

There is a huge increase in frame time stability and low 1% fps in games, giving preference to performance cores, as well as a reduction in stuttering in games that use Easy Anti-Cheat to constantly scan device ports.

## Usage

Run the "**Optimize Power Scheme.cmd**" file.

## Testing

Tested using Lenovo Legion and Asus Rog Strix laptops in CS2, PUBG and Cyberpunk 2077 games.
